#Github Repo for Jacob Gerace

##Purpose
This repo holds many of the projects I completed as an undergraduate at Tufts University for the class COMP20 - Web Programming, under professor Ming Chow.

##Favorite Assignment
Project2: landmarks, was my favorite assignment. I found javascript coding to be the most interesting part of the class by far, and this is the only assignment where coding a lot and coding well was required.

##Personal Growth
In terms of work ethic and maturity, not much. I think most students in COMP20 grew in those respects, but I believe I already experienced that in previous courses. Instead I've grown in my knowledge base to include web programming and security.

##Important things from this course
For me, just learning how to set up a basic website is essential. So Assignment one is the biggest boon to my knowledge base, static html and css. Likewise, learning to use heroku to host a server is also very useful.

Next most important is assignment 4 and understanding security risks. My brother works in that industry so its already been nice to know what he's been talking about. In specific, learning about common vulnerabilities like cross site scripting and injection is interesting.

##What to delve into next
I want to stay the heck away from front end design. I would like to delve more deeply into back end design, and security.
