Acknowledgements:

* Professor Ming for providing AJAX examples that initially worked as a template
 (although the finished code is very different)
 
* Likewise, google for their API and documentation, which also worked as a
 template in some cases (such as the polyline code)
 
* Stackoverflow users talkol and Nathan Lippi for writing up and refactoring
 code to implement the haversine formula in javascript respectively.
