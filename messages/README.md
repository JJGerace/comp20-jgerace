Lab 5
======
**By Jacob Gerace**.

I believe all of the lab has been correctly implemented.

I did not collaborate or discuss this lab with anyone else.

I spent around 1/5 hours on this lab.

Part 1 worked, part 2 did not work, part 3 did not work either.

Important question answer: It is not possible to request the data from a different origin. This is because this is a security hazard. Allowing our app to parse data from the herokuapp website would be harmless in this case, but it would be completely analagous to a malicious website reading your facebook data (if you have both open at the same time). Because of this, by convention you cannot request data from a different origin or from the local machine.
